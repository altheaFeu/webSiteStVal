# A website for Valentine's Day

A local website filled with love, to send to the person who makes your heart beat on February 17th.

To be able to connect, you must have a phpMyAdmin server and create a table with:
- An ID (primary key)
- A token
- The name of your partner
- Your partner's first name
- The nickame of your partner

In config.php, modify the variable $bdd to fit the name of your database 
($bdd = "mysql:host=hostname;dbname=dbname;charset=utf8")

Your partner can now register and log in to access to the rest of the site 😉

Happy Valentine's day ! ❤️
